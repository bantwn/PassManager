# PassManager
PassManager is an android app that lets the user store his passwords into the app. User must register to the system to be able to log in and at his first log in, the app suggests him some categories of passwords to use based on his profile (sex/age). After that, the user can create new categories of passwords (such as emails, website accounts etc) and inside of these categories, he can create more specific elements alongside with their passwords (for instance in emails category: email1@example.com, email2@example.com). He can view the passwords by clicking on these elements, and he can manage his passwords in general (create new/delete etc).
